# Group Project Final Version

## Project Title: WeShare

## Project Synopis:


This application is unique as it allows all the users to be riders (join rides of others) and drivers (post rides for others to join). The riders can view, join, and leave rides. The drivers can post rides and view the riders who joined his/her ride. Both users can communicate via the chat functionality.
